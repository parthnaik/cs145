3. In this question, you are to create a DTD for a small XML data set about world countries. This data is adapted from the Mondial 3.0 database as hosted by the University of Washington, and was originally compiled by the Georg-August University of Goettingen Institute for Informatics. Each country has a name, population, and area (in sq. km). Some countries also list languages (with percentages of the population that speaks each language) and/or cities (with names and populations).
